# MiniProject
This repo captures the basics of how to start making a machine learning application on andrio studio.

# H1 Getting Started
First you want to make sure that you have the necessary tools that you will need to run this project.
In your preferred CL verify that you have python installed by running `python`
[Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
If you have it installed it should say the version number. Example "Python 3.10.2. This will also put you in python exe where you can run
python commmands.
# H2 Installing pytorch
pytorch can be installed many ways.
The easiest way I have found is going to the [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and following its install guide.
# H3 Cloning the repo
md a new file in your file system in CL and using CL do `git init` to start a new git repo.
Then in your CL `git clone https://github.com/Humberto1945/MiniProject.git`
Open this up in andriod studio.
#H4 Running the application
Select the device manager and go through the proccess of setting up a new decvice to run the application
For more info on how to set it up please visit [Andrio Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)
